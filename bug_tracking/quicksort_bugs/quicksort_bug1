When input_array[end_index] becomes the pivot AND contains the same value as input_array[mid_index], the partition method will cause infinite recursion and crash. I found this a couple sessions ago and implemented a fix to avoid the infinite recursion. Unfortunately this fix involved returning the function if the infinite_recursion_flag was set, which prevents input_array from being sorted recursively like it should be in quicksort. This is where the errors have been comming from. It makes sense that it's only occuring in larger arrays because the conditions for the bug aren't very common. The fix will involve finding a way to sort the sub array when the infinte_recursion flag is tripped and THEN returning. Need to find a solution where we can ensure the infinite recursion condition is broken so we can continue sorting using standard quicksort method. Bubble sorting the sub array whenever this comes up would probably work most of the time but there would be rare occurrences where the sub array was very large AND  the infinite recursion conditions were met at the same time and this would kill performance. Need to brainstorm a little. There's obviously a flaw in my partition method since this is happening at all but i'm not going to go back and change it right now i'll just think of an acceptable work around.
